# Econverse Middleware
This is a middleware that makes vtex requests much more **powerful** and **easy** to handle.

## Why will you use it?
Let's be honest that every vtex api is a little messy. It could be the incomprehensible errors, the bad docs for us devs or all the limitation we must deal with.

This middleware handles every of these topics and a bunch more. To name a few:
- Intuitive requests
- Comprehensive errors
- Understandable docs
- Only one URL to care about
- **Is open source!**

## ðŸš• Routes
We tried to make your requests as easy and intuitive as possible, so you can handle it much more easily.

See our [routes guide](https://github.com/gasampaiosouza/e-middleware/tree/master/docs/routes.md) to get started.
